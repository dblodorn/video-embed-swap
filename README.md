# video-embed-swap

Vanilla Javascript function that automatically converts youtube &amp; vimeo url to embed code.

## !?WHY?!

When the backend only has a vimeo / youtube url available and you need to use that for both
a modal plugin on one page, and also use it to do an embed in another instance then stick
this function in your build.

## Package management

Install with Bower: `bower install video-embed-swap`

Install with npm: `npm install video-embed-swap`
